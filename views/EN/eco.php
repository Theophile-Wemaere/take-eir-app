                            At Take EIR, we place utmost importance on the eco-design of our products. We are committed to
                            developing digital health solutions that not only improve patients' lives but also
                            respect the environment. In line with this, our project "Health-EIR" incorporates concrete
                            measures to minimize our ecological footprint throughout the product lifecycle, from design
                            to end-of-life.

                        When designing the Health-EIR electronic casing, we integrated eco-design principles to
                        minimize its environmental impact. Our casing was primarily made using PLA, which is the most
                        commonly used consumable material in FDM 3D printing. PLA is an eco-friendly bioplastic made
                        from corn starch, cassava roots, and beetroot. It is biodegradable, non-toxic, and emits a
                        slight sweet odor during the printing process.

                        We have incorporated energy-efficient technologies to reduce the power consumption of the
                        casing. This not only helps limit our carbon footprint but also extends the battery life.

                        We design the Health-EIR casing to facilitate repair and upgradability. Thus, in case of a
                        malfunction or obsolescence of a device component, we encourage the repair or replacement of
                        only the defective part, reducing resource waste.
